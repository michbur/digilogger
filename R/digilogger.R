#' digilogger - data analysis tools
#'
#' @description \code{digilogger} package is a toolbox for the analysis of POCT data.
#' 
#' @section Motivation  
#' Cardiovascular diseases are one of the main reasons for adult mortality in western world, 
#' leading to huge liability on healthcare system. Lifestyle, genetic disposition, deficiency of clearly 
#' defined risk assessment criteria, as well as high occurrences of misdiagnosis directly contribute to
#' this issue. Due to this fact a rapid and simultaneously detection of biomarkers is necessary.
#' 
#' @section The scope of digilogger  
#' Biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases include hs-CRP, BNP, LDL, HbA1c, ST2 and creatinine.
#' We started to integrated them in a microfluidic microbead chip system that is read-out with our 
#' VideoScan technology (doi:10.1007/10_2011_132) as demonstrated earlier. In addition, 
#' we develop a software which can be used for the analysis. We integrated the biomarkers in 
#' different detection methods (hybridization assays, ELISA, microbead ELISA) and tested those 
#' methods as multiplex assays.
