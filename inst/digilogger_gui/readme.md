### About

The **digilogger** app automatically reads and processes measured values from POCT devices. The raw data are not changed but are entered into a database uniquely identifiable with IDs and hashes.

Currently, only measurements from the VideoScan platform are supported.

After processing, the raw data are qualitatively checked and presented with interactive diagrams and tables.
