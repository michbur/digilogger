# About

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the main reasons for adult mortality in western world, leading to huge liability on healthcare system. Lifestyle, genetic disposition, deficiency of clearly defined risk assessment criteria, as well as high occurrences of misdiagnosis directly contribute to this issue. Due to this fact a rapid and simultaneously detection of biomarkers is necessary. Biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases include hs-CRP, BNP, LDL, HbA1c, ST2 and creatinine. We started to integrated them in a microfluidic microbead chip system that is read-out with our VideoScan technology (doi:10.1007/10_2011_132). In addition, we develop a software, which can be used for the analysis. We integrated the biomarkers in different detection methods (hybridization assays, ELISA, microbead ELISA) and tested those methods as multiplex assays.

The **digilogger** app automatically reads and processes measured values from POCT devices. The raw data are not changed but are entered into a database uniquely identifiable with IDs and hashes.

Currently, only measurements from the VideoScan platform are supported. Details can be found in:

After processing, the raw data are qualitatively checked and presented with interactive diagrams and tables.
