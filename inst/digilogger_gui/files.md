# About

In the **Files** tab the input files can be checked for their plausibility. For each file the file name, its hash value (md5sum), the profile name and the ID are known. This information can be used to check whether an incorrect assignment has been satisfied. **Note: the software currently supports the import of VideoScan files only. To import own files, consider to write your own import function based on the *vs.import.R* file.**
